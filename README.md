## The problem our website solves
Our website provides a platform for solving two of the major barriers in education, i.e, geographical and limited availability of content for specific courses. The website aims to provide one-stop solution to this issue. Both teachers and students can use this website by using their individual logins. The teachers can upload their videos or any other study materials for any course. The students can access this material as per their convenience by signing up with the system. To make the platform more interactive the students can also fill in the feedback form or contact the concerned faculty in case of doubts or difficulties.
